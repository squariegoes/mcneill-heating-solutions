            "John replaced our boiler recently. My wife and I were unsure what type of boiler we needed but John was able to give us lots of expert advice. His price was very reasonable and I would recommend him to anyone."

            "McNeill Heating Solutions recently replaced my gas boiler and upgraded the radiators throughout my home.
            I would just like to say how pleased I am with the quality of workmanship. Everything was completed very professionally and on time. I was also very pleasantly surprised to get a new central thermostat and carbon monoxide monitor included in my price. And though every room was worked in, everything was left pristine on completion.
            A big thank you to McNeill Heating Solutions. I'll certainly use this company again for all my plumbing and heating needs, and would highly recommend."

            "I can recommend McNeill Heating Solutions, extremely professional, knowledgeable and helpful.
            My boiler stopped working, and they attended quickly, providing me with various repair/replacement options to suit my needs and my budget.
            I opted for a new boiler which was installed and operating in next to no time, Iâ€™ll definitely use them for future boiler servicing as well."
